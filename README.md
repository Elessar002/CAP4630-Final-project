# CAP4630-Final-project
Here is my final project for my Intro to AI class

30-Second Peaceful Classical Piano Generator
Group Members: Juan Martinez, Jose Hernandez, Alexander Akyian, Moshe Amar, Firas George

This project is a small generative music system written in Python. It creates a unique, peaceful 30-second classical piano piece
by randomly combining melody notes and consonant chords, then synthesizing them into audio using digital signal processing (DSP).

The output is a fully generated .wav file that sounds like a gentle classical piano melody.

This project demonstrates:
Rule-based generative AI
Algorithmic music composition
Digital signal processing (DSP)
Randomized musical structure
Programmatic audio synthesis

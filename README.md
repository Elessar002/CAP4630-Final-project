AI Generated Classical Piano Music
Team Members: Firas Georges, Moshe Amar, Alexander Akyian, Juan Martinez, Jose Hernandez

Project Overview
Objective: To generate original classical piano music using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Problem: Music composition is a complex creative task that involves long-term structure and harmony. We are attempting to see if an AI can learn these patterns from MIDI data.

Methodology:

Data: MIDI files processed into sequential notes and chords.
Model: A Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
Evaluation: Various metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, etc.) and qualitative listening tests.
